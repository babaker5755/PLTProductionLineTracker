# PLT Production Line Tracker

COP 2001 Project<br> 
PLT Production Line Tracker is the production management solution for a media player production facility.

Management would like the production tracking to be more automated so the workers don't need to spend as much time recording what was produced, the log will be more accurate, and it will be easier to generate production reports.
